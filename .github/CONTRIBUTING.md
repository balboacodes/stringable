# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and are accepted via pull requests. Please review the process and guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Process

1. Fork the project
2. Create a new branch
3. Install dependencies
4. Code, test, commit and push
5. Open a pull request detailing your changes

## Guidelines

- Only submit pull requests for feature parity with Laravel's string helpers. If you think a feature outside of what Laravel offers would benefit the community, [create a discussion](https://github.com/balboacodes/stringable/discussions) about it first.
- Create passing tests for new features and make sure existing tests are passing by running `npm run test`
- Ensure code is formatted by running `npm run format`
